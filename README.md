Since the original Github project has gone stale for a few years, I spun up this fork to continue development. I have a couple new PCBs designed in testing, and some code changes to offer more features and functionality in the works. Expect to see first updates in April/May 2025.

![Vail adapter, assembled and connected](doc/vail-adapter-v2.jpg)


# Features

* Lets you key even if you move focus to another window
* Works with [Vail](https://vail.woozle.org/)
* Works with [VBand](https://hamradio.solutions/vband/), but the window has to remain focused
* Works with [Morse Invaders](https://www.morseinvaders.com/)
* Works with [my CW Training Tools I am building]([https://www.ke9bos.com)
* Optional sidetone generator, which helps with latency
* Implements all nine keyer modes from Vail, in the adapter, so you lunatics can try to key at 50WPM with no latency issues
* Plays received signals in the adapter, so you can turn off your computer speaker
* Free firmware updates for life
* Can be wired up in about 5 minutes

# Setting Up

* [Easy Setup](doc/easy-install.md)
* [Advanced Setup](doc/advanced-install.md)


# Future Work

Things I plan to add:

* [ ] Basic PCB to ease assembly and make a more robust shippable product (ETA: May 2025)
* [ ] Advanced PCB with buttons, passthrough to radio, headphone jack, etc (ETA: May 2025)
* [ ] Super Advanced PCB for wireless(wifi) use. Connect to vail servers without a pc. Likely will have a screen on it too. Keeping costs < $65 total for full build. (ETA: June 2025)
